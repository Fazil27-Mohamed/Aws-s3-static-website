# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Project

## About This Project
This is my cloud internship project where I created and hosted a static
website using Amazon S3. The main goal of this project is to understand
how cloud storage can be used to host a website without managing any server.

The website is built using HTML and CSS and is publicly accessible through
an AWS S3 static website URL.
