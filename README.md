# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting with CloudFront

## About This Project
This is my cloud internship project where I created and hosted a static website using **Amazon S3** and **CloudFront**. The main goal of this project is to understand how cloud storage and a content delivery network (CDN) can be used to host and deliver a website efficiently without managing any server.  

The website is built using **HTML** and **CSS** and is publicly accessible through a CloudFront distribution for faster global delivery.  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**  
- **S3 (Static Website Hosting)**  
- **CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)**  

## What I Did in This Project
1. Created an **S3 bucket** in AWS.  
2. Configured the bucket for **public access**.  
3. Enabled **static website hosting**.  
4. Uploaded the website files to the S3 bucket.  
5. Applied **bucket policy** to allow public access.  
6. Created a **CloudFront distribution** pointing to the S3 bucket.  
7. Configured **default root object** in CloudFront (`index.html`).  
8. Accessed the website using the **CloudFront URL** for faster delivery.  

## Live Website Link
- S3 URL: http://fazil-s3-static-site.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com 
- CloudFront URL: https://d17z3wevsl2pfu.cloudfront.net/

## What I Learned
- Basics of **cloud computing**  
- How **Amazon S3** works  
- **Static website hosting** concepts  
- **Public access** and **bucket policies**  
- Real-time deployment using **AWS Console**  
- Basics of **CloudFront** and **CDN** integration  
- How to improve website performance using **global content delivery**  

## Conclusion
This project gave me **hands-on experience with AWS** and helped me understand how cloud services like S3 and CloudFront can be used in real-world applications. I gained confidence in deploying and managing a **basic cloud-based project** and learned how to deliver content efficiently to users worldwide.
